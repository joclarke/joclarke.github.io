Venture’s goals are threefold– to offer Fellows hands-on entrepreneurship experience, to grow startup companies around the US, and to revitalize American cities through the growth of these companies and companies the Fellows will eventually go on to found.</p>
<h2 id="Training-Camp"><a href="#Training-Camp" class="headerlink" title="Training Camp"></a>Training Camp</h2><p>I’m currently at training camp in Providence, RI, a five week program in which we study, compete, and collaborate to learn the skills necessary to plunge into work at the startups that have hired us this fall. These are skills span the spectrum in terms of “hard” and “soft,” from coding to adopting an internal locus of control.</p>
<p>I want to take the opportunity now to outline my general goals for the remainder of training camp.</p>
<h2 id="Goals"><a href="#Goals" class="headerlink" title="Goals"></a>Goals</h2><ol>
<li><p>To be on a first-name basis with every Fellow.<br>I want to come away with a few deep relationships and friendships, but it would be a shame to miss out on any of the Fellows and their stories. We have some amazing people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To identify and explore new affinities for different aspects of the startup world.<br>I’m coming in to training camp with very little business experience. I hope to come away from camp not only educated in key functions of startups and their employees, but with new interests or even passions that I can explore on the side which may or may not be related to my role in Technical Sales.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To grow as a leader.<br>I’ve never thought of myself as a leader of a particular sort. Yes, I’ve found myself in leadership roles at various times in my life, but more by accident than intent. In the past week, I’ve not only found myself surrounded by leaders, but have begun (for the first time) to recognize myself as one.<br>What sort of leader will I be? How can I shape that vision? I think it’s a combination of stating my hopes and allowing my experiences over the next five weeks to constantly inform the working out of those hopes, so here we go:<br>I often have a vision for a project. I hope to communicate that vision and adhere to it.<br>I value community. I hope to promote the flourishing of the relationships within my team and around it.<br>I hope to serve others.<br>I hope to uplift those around me.<br>I hope to stay humble.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To love others well.<br>Self explanatory. Always the nucleus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
