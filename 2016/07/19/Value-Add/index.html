I’ve seen some great projects in the works, efforts designed to strengthen our communities, focus on truly revitalizing our cities, little things that may in fact leave the world better than we found it.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking long and hard about what I’d like to do, something tangible and longterm that reflects the things I really care about in life, especially as they relate to VFA, the things that get me up in the morning. Something that could possibly orient people toward each other. </p>
<h2 id="Family-Dinners"><a href="#Family-Dinners" class="headerlink" title="Family Dinners"></a>Family Dinners</h2><p>Family has always been one of the most important things in my life. Like, probably top three. Coming from a big Italian family, two tenets were enforced from an early age– family is not restricted to blood and nothing unites family like food. I’d like to bring these two pillars of my sense of family to Philly. </p>
<p>This is by no means exclusive. Each week, I’d like to have five or six different people over for a dinner to spend time together. They will not all be affiliated with VFA– I want to bring all the communities I find in the city together.</p>
<p>My office is in the southernmost section of the city, so on Fridays I’ll take the long way home and pass through the Italian section, pick up some ingredients, and get dinner going for everyone that evening.</p>
<h2 id="The-Accelerator"><a href="#The-Accelerator" class="headerlink" title="The Accelerator"></a>The Accelerator</h2><p>A second piece of this project will be my involvement with the VFA Accelerator. Sergei has begun to take me on as a mentee, and I’ve talked to him about volunteering my time and work to the Accelerator. While I have no idea whether or not I’ll start a company, I think the Accelerator is an incredible resource and if I’m not building something at very least I want to be empowering others to do so.</p>
