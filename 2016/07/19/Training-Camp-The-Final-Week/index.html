It’s been a wild, transformative, exhausting two weeks. I’ve learned so much, grown so much, and seen so many new sides of myself I think it’s going to take several weeks to process it all. I leave Providence in four days, so I thought I’d post a short update.</p>
<h2 id="Goals"><a href="#Goals" class="headerlink" title="Goals"></a>Goals</h2><p>I’ll take a second now to briefly reflect on the goals I made before arriving, a status report of sorts.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To be on a first-name basis with every Fellow.<br>I’m almost there on this one, which is quite an accomplishment for someone as bad with names as I am. I think if I do a little social media stalking later, I’ll have everyone down!</p>
</li>
<li><p>To identify and explore new affinities for different aspects of the startup world.<br>I’ve definitely got some great interest areas to explore both on the side and at work once I get out to Philly. I’m really stoked on human-centered design and good UX/UI practices, which seem to go hand-in-hand due to their focus on the user. Being in a product-centered role, I think I can explore these thoroughly in my job. I’d also like to take a class through the American Graphics Institute to study UX/UI a little more.<br>I’ve also discovered an attraction to data analysis and the insights it carries. I want to learn a little more about it on my own time by learning SQL and Python and taking on small data challenges through (Kaggle.com)[www.kaggle.com].</p>
</li>
<li><p>To grow as a leader.<br>Maybe I’ve achieved this one in a roundabout way. I never project managed in a challenge or lead a discussion. I’m not sure I made an impact at all, really. But I stayed true to the things I value, those basic truths to which I cling. I’ve learned even more that there’s so much I don’t know and that I’m so bad at having certain conversations. I’ve met amazing people and seen so much hope and hard work even in the midst of uncertainty and difficulty and struggle. Love has been proven to me again and again. And I’m happy with that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To love others well.<br>Always a struggle, forever learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Three-Things"><a href="#Three-Things" class="headerlink" title="Three Things"></a>Three Things</h2><p>Yesterday, we had a talk from Melissa Withers about life at a startup. In the talk, she suggested we pick three things to work on over the next two years, so I’d like to take a moment to talk through that. I want to invest time furthering something I’m good at, developing something I love, and learning something new.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Better my relationships<br>I love community, I love people, I love relationships. Building and maintaining these relationships has been a skill I’ve been privileged enough to cultivate over the years, and I want to invest time continuing that, especially with regard to mentoring relationships.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Invest in reading and writing<br>Lifegiving activities. I haven’t been able to practice them as much as I’d like in the recent years, and I’d love to grow in these areas in this next chapter, especially since they relate to my longterm goal of teaching. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn to build physical things<br>Hayden and I want to build things together. I want to play with Raspberry PIs, code them, analyze them. I want to woodwork and use tools and put real things into the world. This is a passion of mine, and a big part of life that I think is essential for me to learn. These are skills I can pass on to kids and mentees or whatever. They can build my home, even. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Final-Note"><a href="#Final-Note" class="headerlink" title="Final Note"></a>Final Note</h2><p>Before I end this update, I want to lay something out. This website is about a person– me. It’s self indulgent, a catalogue of things I’ve learned, both necessary and extraneous. It’s a way for me to sort through what I think is vital to my life at different times. One day, maybe it will be a record. If you find this, know that I’m being candid because we learn from each others’ lives.</p>
<p>If my life and projects, good and bad, teach something and help someone create something good that wasn’t there before, I’ve succeeded. We’re here to lift people up, to shrink so community can grow. I hope you find that in this record. </p>
