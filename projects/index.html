    <h2>Fiction</h2>
    <h3>Voice in My Head</h3>
    <p>Inspired by a conversation with my mentor, this is a story about life, death, and conversation. Read it below.</p>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@jimanji/voice-in-my-head-281a0a8bf5b7#.h161dtetv">The story</a>

    <h3>Chapelwood</h3>
    <p>This story pulls from my time in high school. It's about growing up, finding meaning, and how we change. It's based on the song St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues by La Dispute.</p>

    <h3>1. The Website Challenge</h3>
    <p>For this challenge, we were tasked with creating a website for a non-profit in Providence called Mixed Magic Theatre. MMT is a not-for-profit theatre company dedicated to putting diverse images on stage, giving a voice to the marginalized through theatre.</p>
    <p>Below is a screenshot from the site we designed. Our Squarespace account had expired when we took the image, so our images no longer render on the page. We went a little too minimalistic with the site, but learned a great deal from the process with regard to good UX/UI design.</p>

    <h3>2. The Pecha Kucha</h3>
    <p>We were tasked with creating and presenting a pecha kucha-- a five minute presentation of 15 slides which advanced automatically every 20 seconds. I chose to discuss the importance of storytelling as my topic and hand-doodled my slides.</p>

    <h3>3. The Fellow Founder Challenge</h3>
    <p>In this challenge, we completed different tasks for two companies founded by older Fellows. We developed a six-month marketing strategy for the new e-commerce platform in the works for ColorHub's B2C corrugated cardboard printing service and executed a guerilla marketing campaign to sign up beta testers for a social media network called Yodel.</p>

    <h3>4. The Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>For our final project, we were tasked with using Ideo's human-centered design principles to create and pitch a new-to-world product over the course of the week. Our team was assigned the problem of improving the waiting experience for trains or buses.</p>
    <p>We visited Providence's bus terminal, Kennedy Plaza, and interviewed many riders. Many of the complaints revolved around the unappealling physical space of the plaza, so we decided to prototype a community garden for the station. The work I did on this project is summed up in dozens of interviews and sketches which I cannot catalogue here, but the notebook will stay with me.</p>
